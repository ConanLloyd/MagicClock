# Location Clock

Location Clock is inspired by a love of all things magical, and scientific. A combination of reading Harry Potter with my 8 year old and her "simple machines"
STEM lessons in school, we decided to embark on building our very own physical location clock. Already having Home Assistant setup and configured for my wife
and I, we chose to build upon that along with ESPHome.

## Build Guide

## Inspiration

For this project, I drew inspiration from the following similar projects

1. [Magic Clock](https://github.com/brgerig/Magic-Clock): Most of the 3D print files for the assembly were used and/or remixed from here.
2. [Printable Props](https://printableprops.jimdo.com/en/harry-potter/weasley-clock/): Pascal BÃ¶cker graciously shared the STLs for the clock hands with me.
