# Location Clock

Location Clock is inspired by a love of all things magical, and scientific. A combination of reading Harry Potter with my 8 year old and her "simple machines"
STEM lessons in school, we decided to embark on building our very own physical location clock. Already having Home Assistant setup and configured for my wife
and I, we chose to build upon that along with ESPHome.

You can follow along here to build your own.

## Inspiration

For this project, I drew inspiration from the following similar projects

1. [Magic Clock](https://github.com/brgerig/Magic-Clock): Most of the 3D print files for the assembly were used and/or remixed from here.
2. [Printable Props](https://printableprops.jimdo.com/en/harry-potter/weasley-clock/): Pascal BÃ¶cker graciously shared the STLs for the clock hands with me.

## Software

The SVGs in the [graphics folder](https://github.com/hunterjm/location-clock/tree/main/graphics) were created in Inkscape and are editable to change your locations and names. The `names.svg` file has a hidden layer with a to-scale copy of the clock hands I printed for alignment.

## The Build

Assembly of the control mechanism was the most difficult part of this project, and I did not take near enough pictures or notes of the process. That being said, a lot of it
is pretty self explanitory, so I will give a general overview of the steps I took and some gotchas along the way.

### Clock Tear Down

1. 4 screws held the glass assembly of the clock face on from the inside of the body.
2. The clock hands pull right off - they require some pressure.
3. Remove the nut from the clock face, and the old time mechanism should come right out.
4. The glass was held in with a plastic support held by two small screws. Remove the glass so it doesn't break. I also used a razor blade to scrape off the "REGULATOR" text from the glass.
5. The face was held on with 4 L brackets on the side of the clock. I removed it for easier access to build the mechanism.
5. The clock face was attached with some double sided tape and pulled right off.
6. There was a pre-existing 1/2 block of wood in the clock body that was too small and needed to be removed. It was held on with 2 staples, but no glue. I used a pick to pull the staples out.
