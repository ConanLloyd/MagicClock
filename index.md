# Location Clock

Location Clock is inspired by a love of all things magical, and scientific. A combination of reading Harry Potter with my 8 year old and her "simple machines"
STEM lessons in school, we decided to embark on building our very own physical location clock. Already having Home Assistant setup and configured for my wife
and I, we chose to build upon that along with ESPHome.

You can follow along here to build your own.

## Inspiration

For this project, I drew inspiration from the following similar projects

1. [Magic Clock](https://github.com/brgerig/Magic-Clock): Most of the 3D print files for the assembly were used and/or remixed from here.
2. [Printable Props](https://printableprops.jimdo.com/en/harry-potter/weasley-clock/): Pascal BÃ¶cker graciously shared the STLs for the clock hands with me.

## Software

The SVGs in the [graphics folder](https://github.com/hunterjm/location-clock/tree/main/graphics) were created in Inkscape and are editable to change your locations and names. The `names.svg` file has a hidden layer with a to-scale copy of the clock hands I printed for alignment.

## The Build

Assembly of the control mechanism was the most difficult part of this project, and I did not take near enough pictures or notes of the process. That being said, a lot of it
is pretty self explanitory, so I will give a general overview of the steps I took and some gotchas along the way.

### Clock Tear Down

1. 4 screws held the glass assembly of the clock face on from the inside of the body.
2. The clock hands pull right off - they require some pressure.
3. Remove the nut from the clock face, and the old time mechanism should come right out.
4. The glass was held in with a plastic support held by two small screws. Remove the glass so it doesn't break. I also used a razor blade to scrape off the "REGULATOR" text from the glass.
5. The face was held on with 4 L brackets on the side of the clock. I removed it for easier access to build the mechanism.
5. The clock face was attached with some double sided tape and pulled right off.
6. There was a pre-existing 1/2 block of wood in the clock body that was too small and needed to be removed. It was held on with 2 staples, but no glue. I used a pick to pull the staples out.

### Clock Face

1. I spray painted over the aluminum clock face with flat white paint to cover the old numbers.
2. I created a [new face](https://github.com/hunterjm/location-clock/blob/main/graphics/clock_face.svg) in Inkscape and printed it on the vinyl sticker paper.
3. After the paint dried, I was able to apply the new face to the old aluminum one and trim it down with an exacto knife.

### Motor Mechanism

Here is where I didn't take nearly enough pictures, and for that I'm sorry!

1. Cut your 1/2" MDF/Scrap Wood/Plywood down to size to fit inside the clock.
2. Using the top mounting bracket as a template, drill holes through the wood for the center piece and the 4 #10 screws in the corners.
3. Hammer in the T-Nuts to the back of the board.
4. Cut off the heads of the 3" #10 screws and thread a nut through to fix the threads. You can use a bench grinder to clean up the cuts, but it's not necessary.
5. Thread the cut off end through the board and into the T-Nuts.
6. Place the top mounting bracket onto the new threaded rods and add 4 nuts.
7. In a clockwise motion, place the motors (attached to the brackets and with the gears on) with the height of two nuts between them. The first two should be facing up, and the following two facing down for the most compact assembly. The gears on the two facing down will actually be lower than those on the motors facing up below them.
8. Starting with the largest aluminum rod, thread it through the assembly and mark where it contacts the gear and give yourself plenty of space sticking out of the front to attach hands. Cut it with your hand saw, and clean it up with the exacto knife and/or bench grinder. **Make sure you do not bend the rod!** Verify the step smaller rod can still move freely inside.
9. Super glue the gear to one end of the aluminum rod and finess it into the mechanism so the gears are touching.
10. Rinse and repeat for the next 2 rods.  **Read the next line before cutting the last rod!** It's OK if things feel tight and like they aren't lining up properly. Clearances are tight. Until your rods have preassure on all 4 sides from all 4 motors, you will probably have to push and prod and pull and curse.
11. The last rod has a place to fit into the mounting bracket base, so it will be a little longer, and the gear won't be glued on to the end. Make sure you attach the bracket base and measure from the front of the clock!
